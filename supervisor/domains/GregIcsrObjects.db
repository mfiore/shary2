(
;;Object.type NAME TYPE CLASS 
;NAME is the name of the object
;TYPE explains which kind of object it is (ex. TAPE, CUBE, PLACEMAT, TABLE, HUMAN)
;CLASS is a second grouping of objects related to their functions (ex. PICKABLE, PLACEMAT)
;this is then used for actions and monitor spheres. Ex. cubes have a certaing size for monitor spheres. The action take can be done on PICKABLE objects etc.

;; When we add a new CLASS we should edit the PlanManager.manageHumanActions OP (the code in that functions explains the point where the user should edit) (if this class of objects could be relevant to monitor human actions) and add the Spark.typeMonitorSphere predicate in the Spark.db file.

;;When we create a new TYPE we should add the Spark.sphereParameter predicate in Spark.db
